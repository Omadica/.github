We present a complete video surveillance kit for end-users and small retailers. We believe in our on-prem solutions! You can buy the suggested hardware and install and run our software solutions (you can find compiled binary and sources in this organization) on your devices. No remote controls, no cloud, no costly subscriptions, and no third person can access your data.  

More often than not, non-on-prem solutions behind the promise of better coverage or greater security lie only in a violation of end-user privacy.

Omadica responds to the growing need for freedom and transparency in surveillance services. Our GitHub organization offers suggestions for open-source software that anyone can install on a Raspberry Pi (or similar hardware) and quickly create video surveillance customized to your needs.

If you are not a hacking guy and prefer a just-installed and working platform, you can contact us at integration@omadica.com to express your needs. We will process your request and send you a quotation soon. The quotation will cover just hardware + shipment cost. If you are satisfied with our products, please leave a small economic contribution or better, become our sponsor [![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sponsor&message=%E2%9D%A4&logo=GitHub&color=%23fe8e86)](https://github.com/sponsors/Omadica) it's very important for us because all of our work relys on free offerings.

Once the package is sent, we cannot access it anymore. The system's control will be only up to you.
